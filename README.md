# Dental-Clinic-System
A dental clinic system using a chatbot and dockerized services

Business Scenario

The aim is to implement a Chatbot that relies on a set of REST API based services to perform booking in a dental clinic.

First, let us imagine that the appointment booking operation in the dental clinic is based on the following workflow (modelled as state machines).


The scenario here is the patient contact the Chatbot to request for a booking. If the patient needs to specify the doctor or ask for the list of doctors available. After the selection of the dentist the patient needs to specify the preferred timeslot the chatbot checks if the timeslot is available and if not, it provides list of available timeslots. The patient will select one of the available timeslots and the booking is made.

The assumption is that we have at least three dentists. They are available from 9AM-5PM every day. Each dentist by nature has a timetable.

The specification are deliberately left open to allow students to take follow their own strategy to achieve the required outcome. You are allowed to use any of three approaches (Rule, ML, Flow) to build your chatbot. 



API Implementation

System overview



The diagram above shows the high level components of the system you are building. The Dentist and Timeslot services are to be deployed in a docker container and the chatbot should communicate with the services through REST API calls.

To summarise the main functionalities:

Get available dentists
Get dentist information
Get available timeslots for each dentist
Reserve timeslot
Cancelling appointment
The following describes the API you should implement.

The resources and their URI patterns: 

There are two types of resources to be managed: Dentist and Timeslot. It is up to you to design these resources and their URI patterns. Indeed, this will be your first task. Go through the scenario and make sure that you have every piece of data needed to service the scenario is covered.

Some suggested information for each resource:

Dentist: name, location, specialization (e.g., Paediatric Dentistry, Orthodontics, Oral Surgeryâ€¦etc.)
Timeslots: 1 hour timeslots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, status flag (reserved, available)
Managing resources:

It is important that all HTTP methods implemented by you satisfy the safety and idempotency properties of REST operations. It is also important that the design of the API allow stateless communications.

It is part of your design task to choose an appropriate HTTP method to implement the following management operations.

Persisting resources:

Ideally, you would like to store these data in a persisting data source. Since our dental clinic system have separate services (Dentist, Timeslot) for different functionalities, you need to make sure these services are isolated (all the communications/data exchanges between them are via REST APIs). The form and type of data is up to the students to decide.

RESTful APIs are stateless:

Your implementation of APIs should show that your APIs are stateless and all communications are self-contained with the messages.
